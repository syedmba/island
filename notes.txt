According to Zhuangzi, human beings often become trapped in societal conventions, expectations, and desires, which can lead to suffering and dissatisfaction. He believed that individuals should strive to detach themselves from the norms and values imposed by society and instead cultivate a sense of inner harmony and spontaneity.

Zhuangzi advocated for a perspective that challenged conventional wisdom and sought to transcend dualistic thinking. He emphasized the importance of following one's own nature and embracing the natural flow of the world. By letting go of personal desires and attachments, individuals could attain a state of wu-wei, which can be loosely translated as "effortless action" or "non-action." This state involves0 acting in accordance with the natural order of things rather than forcefully imposing one's will.

It's worth noting that while Zhuangzi advocated for freeing oneself from social entanglements, his philosophy doesn't suggest complete withdrawal from society. Instead, he encouraged individuals to find a balance between engaging with the world and maintaining inner freedom.
