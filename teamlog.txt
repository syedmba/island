- using bid-ask spread to trade in amethysts
- starfruits not yet implemented
- for starfruit could consider sinusoidal fitting / oscillators / moving averages
- which one depends on historical trends
- do starfruit oscillate back and forth
- do bullish/bearish trends persist for long durations

- there are N goldfish passing by, where N is unknown
- each team will get the same goldfish passing by, that is, the 
  prices each team encounters shall be the same
- goldfish reserve price lies between 900 and 1000
- P(R <= 1000) = 1

Tue, 9 Apr
- solved probability distribution to get E(R1) = 967 and E(R2) = 985.05
- hence low bid = 967 and high bid = 985

Fri, 12 Apr
- Algo implemented using linear regression on 3 coefficients for starfruit and market-making for amethysts
- Round 1 algo: 32,368 seashells
- Round 1 manual: 94,437 seashells

Sat, 13 Apr
- Round 2
- Current optimal solution for manual is seashells >> pizza >> wasabi >> seashells >> pizza >> seashells 
- Trade multiplier of 1.0569693888 = 1.41 * 0.48 * 1.56 * 1.41 * 0.71
- NOTE: value is 1.0569693887999998 with seashells >> pizza >> seashells >> pizza >> wasabi >> seashells
