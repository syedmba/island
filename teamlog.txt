- using bid-ask spread to trade in amethysts
- starfruits not yet implemented
- for starfruit could consider sinusoidal fitting / oscillators / moving averages
- which one depends on historical trends
- do starfruit oscillate back and forth
- do bullish/bearish trends persist for long durations

- there are N goldfish passing by, where N is unknown
- each team will get the same goldfish passing by, that is, the 
  prices each team encounters shall be the same
- goldfish reserve price lies between 900 and 1000
- P(R <= 1000) = 1

- solved probability distribution to get E(R1) = 967 and E(R2) = 985.05
- hence low bid = 967 and high bid = 985

Fri, 12 Apr
- Algo implemented using linear regression on 3 coefficients for starfruit and market-making for amethysts
- Round 1 algo: 32,368 seashells
- Round 1 manual: 94,437 seashells
- Position: 466 overall, 158 algo, 1421 manual

- Round 2
- Current optimal solution for manual is seashells >> pizza >> wasabi >> seashells >> pizza >> seashells 
- Trade multiplier of 1.0569693888 = 1.41 * 0.48 * 1.56 * 1.41 * 0.71
- NOTE: value is 1.0569693887999998 with seashells >> pizza >> seashells >> pizza >> wasabi >> seashells

- If the sunlight exposure is less than 7 hours a day, production will decrease with 4% for every ten minutes.
- Ideal humidity for orchids to grow is between 60% and 80%. Outside those limits, productions will fall with 2% for every 5% point of humidity change
- Shipping costs and import and export tariffs
- Storage is at 0.1 seashell per orchid per timestamp

- Production falls => Demand Increases?
- Is the exact relation of the supply-demand a factor?
- What if we use linear regression on humidity and sunlight
- Thoughts: WHAT IF sunlight and humidity and sunlight are either negatively or positively correlated
            and we can find out which one by looking at the values
            and subsequently use regression or other price prediction
